# CodeSanook Workshop 001: React, TypeScript and VS Code.

## Create an App with React and Typescript `react-create-app` 

Run in your terminal: 

`$ npx create-react-app APP_NAME --typescript`

> Replace APP_NAME for the name of your app

The output will be like that:

```
You can now view contact-final in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:3000/
  On Your Network:  http://192.168.1.8:3000/

Note that the development build is not optimized.
To create a production build, use yarn build (or npm run build).
```
